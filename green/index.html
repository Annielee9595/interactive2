    <p> This is one of a series of self-portraits that Warhol made in 1966–67, all based on the same photograph. His facial features, although always identifiable, also act as patterns of densely layered colour. The image is painted in such a way as to minimise Warhol’s human qualities. Any expressive paint handling is suppressed by the silkscreened surface. Warhol said his intention was to ‘completely remove all the hand gesture from art and become noncommittal, anonymous’.</p>
